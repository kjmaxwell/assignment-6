**Package Title:** ggplot2
**Location:** ggplot2 is available on CRAN, is part of tidyverse, and can be installed with: install.packages("ggplot2")
You can also find it on GitHub at: https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2

**Vignette(s)**
ggplot2 has multiple vignettes, which can be accessed using:
vignette(package = "ggplot2")
Key vignettes include:
"ggplot2-specs": Explains aesthetic mappings and scales.
"extending-ggplot2": Explains how to create custom ggplot2 extensions.
"ggplot2-in-packages": Explains using ggplot2 in packages
“ggplot2”:  an introduction to ggplot2

**Application(s)**
ggplot2 is used in many different contexts like blogs, tutorials, and social media posts for data visualization, and portraying some sort of pattern to the audience. Ggplot2 graphics are all over Twitter posts, blocks, and websites to illustrate data or patterns. The package is also used in interactive dashboards built with shiny and in reporting like RMarkdown.

**Review**
I like ggplot2 for tastefully expressing data with a couple of variables. We could create a bar chart where the x-axis represents different product categories, the y-axis shows the total revenue, and the fill color distinguishes between online and in-store purchase. There are multiple variables that can be neatly conveyed. The ability to map aesthetics dynamically to variables makes ggplot2 especially useful for exploratory data analysis and storytelling. Overall, ggplot2 does a fantastic job of creating scientific data plots to artistic renditions of data patterns. 
I have not explored, but I wish I had R templates to use ggplot2 to plug in your data files and column titles. Ggplot2 is so well known in the R community that I bet these resources exist. 
The package is easy to learn and use, and I would recommend it regardless of programming experience. However, ggplot2 has a learning curve if users are trying to create highly customized plots, which often require deep knowledge of themes and scale functions.
